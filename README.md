__DirectionalLight.html__ is a working example to demonstrate shadows when using _THREE.DirectionalLight(..)_. &nbsp;Note how the values for the light's orthographic camera have to be set appropriately for your setup.

In contrast, __PointLight.html__ shows that shadows can be created using _THREE.PointLight(..)_ without specifiyng camera properties.
